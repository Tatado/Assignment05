1.
Multiple inheritance means that a subclass can inherit from two or more superclasses. C++ allows multiple inheritance.
2.
The delegation pattern is an object-oriented design pattern that allows object composition to achieve the same code reuse as inheritance.
3.
 Composition is a concept in object-oriented programming that models the relationship between two classes. 
4.
A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument. 
It passes the instance as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions.
5.
This feature is mostly intended to avoid namespace collisions in instances, not to restrict access to names in general.
